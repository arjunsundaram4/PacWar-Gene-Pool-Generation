How to run this:
Run py gene.py

How does it work:
It runs the main function in gene which calls the file helper functions from filehelper.py. We use texfiles to store and monitor the winners in winners.txt and the best gene in finalchamps.txt for each iteration (generations of iterations)
We use mutations and crossovers to get the best of the lot and score with each other based on scoring from pacwar tournament.

File output:
Has scores and the gene with the collective lot which has the population from each iteraiton.
